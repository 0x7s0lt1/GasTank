## â›½Gastank

#### GasTank is a secure on-chain ETH vault that allows users to deposit and manage balances individually.
#### The contract owner can authorize trusted pipes to interact with the system. Pipes and the owner can burn (deduct) ETH from user balances when a service has been completed, collecting the cost into the owner's wallet.
#### This setup allows users to prepay for services, while giving the owner (or trusted executors) the ability to charge users efficiently and safely.
