## â›½Gastank

#### GasTank is a secure on-chain ETH vault that allows users to deposit and manage balances individually.
#### The contract owner can authorize trusted pipes to interact with the system. Pipes and the owner can burn (deduct) ETH from user balances when a service has been completed, collecting the cost into the owner's wallet.
#### This setup allows users to prepay for services, while giving the owner (or trusted executors) the ability to charge users efficiently and safely.


## Usage

```solidity
    import {GasTank} from "./GasTank.sol";

    contract MyContract {
        
        GastTank private immutable gasTank;

        constructor(address owner) {
            gasTank = new Gastank(owner);
            gasTank.setPipe(address(this), true);
        }

        function doSomething() external {
            uint256 startGas = gasLeft();

            // do something

            uint256 cost = (  startGas - gasLeft() ) * tx.gasprice;
            
            gasTank.burn(msg.sender, cost);
            
        }
    }
